Hacking
=======

Are you without a nice project and just dying to cut your teeth
on the Ruby plugin for KDevelop?

Go ahead then! You might want to get in touch with
Miquel Sabaté (mssola), the current maintainer; and Alexander Dymo (adymo),
the original author.

Any help will be appreciated but when you write patches, please
follow the kdelibs coding style.
