KDevelop Ruby Support
=====================

== Generating the documentation ==

This plugin needs the generated documentation/builtins.rb file to exist. 
In order to generate this file, you'll have to use the
documentation/kdevruby_doc.rb script. The expected usage is:

  ruby kdevruby_doc.rb source_dir output_file
  
The 'source_dir' parameter is the path to the Ruby source code tree, and the
'output_file' parameter is the name of the finally generated file.

== Testing ==

In order to test the DUChain and the Code completion you can do it as in
any other KDevelop Language Plugin by going to the build directory and
executing the different executables. To test the parser, please read the
README file that can be found inside the parser/ directory.

But you can do all of this automatically by using guard. From the root
directory execute:
  $ guard -w relative/path/to/the/build/directory

We provide a Gemfile that handles all the dependencies. In particular, guard
and its dependencies will be installed, as well for the assert_same gem, which
is used to test the parser.

Finally, note that to test the parser it's required a ruby version < 1.9.

== Authors ==

- Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
  (Started the plugin)

- Miquel Sabaté <mikisabate@gmail.com>
  (Maintainer, Parser)

== Hacking ==

Are you without a nice project and just dying to cut your teeth
on the Ruby plugin for KDevelop?

Go ahead then! You might want to get in touch with
Miquel Sabaté (mssola), the current maintainer; and Alexander Dymo (adymo),
the original author.

Any help will be appreciated but when you write patches, please
follow the kdelibs coding style.
