KDevelop Ruby Support
=====================

== Generating the documentation ==

This plugin needs the generated documentation/builtins.rb file to exist. 
In order to generate this file, you'll have to use the
documentation/kdevruby_doc.rb script. The expected usage is:

  ruby kdevruby_doc.rb source_dir output_file
  
The 'source_dir' parameter is the path to the Ruby source code tree, and the
'output_file' parameter is the name of the finally generated file.

== Authors ==

- Alexander Dymo <adymo@kdevelop.org>
  (Started the plugin)

- Miquel Sabaté <mikisabate@gmail.com>
  (Maintainer, Parser)

== Hacking ==

Are you without a nice project and just dying to cut your teeth
on the Ruby plugin for KDevelop?

Go ahead then! You might want to get in touch with
Miquel Sabaté (mssola), the current maintainer; and Alexander Dymo (adymo),
the original author.

Any help will be appreciated but when you write patches, please
follow the kdelibs coding style.
