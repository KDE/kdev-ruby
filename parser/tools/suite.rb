# This script executes "ruby-parser" to test every *.rb file
# located in parser/tests/ and outputs in a file. Then it makes
# a diff with the generated files against the expected results.
# Finally it outputs the results and it cleans the parser/tests
# directory.
# You can also pass the name of a test as a parameter so you
# can run it.

##
# This function does the dirty job. Basically it executes the parser to create
# a file containing the output of the parser. The next step is to make a diff
# between the expected results and the generated output. It detects this cases:
#   - Test OK if all was ok.
#   - Test Failed: if something went wrong
#       -> Bad Syntax if the parser "disliked" our code.
