Are you without a nice project and just dying to cut your teeth
on the Ruby plugin for KDevelop?

Go ahead then! You might want to get in touch with
Miquel Sabat√© (mssola), the current maintainer; and Alexander Dymo (adymo),
the original author.

Any help will be appreciated but when you write patches, please
follow the kdelibs coding style.
