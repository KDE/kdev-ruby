# KDevelop Ruby Support

This is a [KDevelop](https://www.kdevelop.org/) language plugin that
implements the support for the Ruby programming language. It provides
everything that you can expect from a KDevelop language plugin such as:

- Parsing of full projects.
- Semantic highlighting.
- Code browsing.
- Full code completion.

## Build and Install

Some distributions have this plugin as a precompiled package already. If you
want to build this plugin yourself, the page on
[KDE TechBase](https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KDevelop4/Ruby) has all the
info you need and more.

If you're using Mac OSX, you can also try out the old plugin maintained by
Alexander Dymo that can be installed through
[Homebrew](https://github.com/adymo/homebrew-kde).

## Contributing

All the basic info that you need can be found in
[KDE TechBase](https://techbase.kde.org/Projects/KDevelop4/Ruby).

The preferred way to report bugs is through the [KDE Bugtracking
System](https://bugs.kde.org), and patches should be submitted through
[Review Board](https://git.reviewboard.kde.org/r/new/). That being said,
you can also submit issues and pull requests through the Github
[mirror](https://github.com/mssola/kdev-ruby).

The coding style used in this plugin is of my
[own](https://github.com/mssola/conventions/blob/master/cpp.md). This coding
style is compliant with the [KDE Coding
Style](https://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style) as described in
[this](https://github.com/mssola/conventions/blob/master/cpp.md#compliance-with-other-coding-conventions)
section. When writing patches you should at least follow the KDE Coding Style.
